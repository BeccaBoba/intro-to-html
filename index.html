            this is a test.  Hello! My name is Rebecca and i'm glad to be in your class. Some fun things about me is that I love going to the gym. I love working out and lifting weights in my spare time and overall enjoy being active. Another fun thing about me is I do love to draw. I love working with pens and drawing fun charcaters/people with cool outfits and accessories. When i'm not doing any of these things, I do enjoy baking and cooking for myself and experimenting with recipes and new foods.

            I also enjoy listening to a lot of muisc and exploring different genres of music it's a little concerning. Some of my favourite shows to watch are Regular Show and Adventure Time. Both shows are super nostaglic to me and they just make me laugh. I also love shopping and looking at perfumes especially vanilla ones those are just the best in my opinion. And lastly we can't forget about movies! This movie has been my 1# since I was a kid and it's the movie Rio.
